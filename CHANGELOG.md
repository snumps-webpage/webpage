## [2026-02-09]

### Added
- **Caching Policy Documentation**: Created `docs/CACHE.md` with detailed TTL values and management strategy.
- **Refresh Dashboard**: Added a manual refresh button on the user dashboard to bypass cache and fetch fresh data.
- **Admin App Privacy**: Moved sensitive details (email, phone number) into a collapsible "View More" dropdown in the registration application view.

### Changed
- **Server Caching**: Extended `withCache` wrapper to `getApplications` and `getSeminarRequests` to improve admin dashboard performance.

## [2026-02-08]

### Added
- **Prestigious Heritage Theme**: A complete UI overhaul implementing an "Ivy League" academic aesthetic.
  - New typography: Playfair Display & Nanum Myeongjo for headers, Inter & Noto Sans KR for body.
  - Bilingual optimization: Balanced font weights for English and Korean.
  - Data Clarity: JetBrains Mono applied to emails, phone numbers, dates, and IDs to eliminate character ambiguity (e.g., 0 vs o).
  - Refined Color Palette: Warm paper backgrounds, deep academic navy/teal accents, and flattened "print-like" UI components.

### Fixed
- **Performance Latency**: Reduced action delays by up to 50% through:
  - In-memory caching of Google OAuth Access Tokens (Mail Service).
  - Parallelizing independent Notion API requests in admin actions.
  - Implementing a self-cleaning caching mechanism to prevent memory leaks.
- **UI Consistency**: Standardized status badges, button shapes, and card headers across all routes.
